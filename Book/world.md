### Government
A monarchy supported by a small administrative beaurocracy. The eldest child, male or female, is coronated upon their 21st birthday or their predecessor's 50th birthday, whichever comes last. In addition to the beaurocracy, there is a supporting council elected every year by artisans with a representative for each profession.
### History
The "Old Empire". Formerly the nation that ruled the entirety of the human race. Divided when the New Empire was born. The New Empire took over the majority of the mainland "Old Empire". The Isles broke away when the New Empire was born, and the New Empire or Artenia has yet to reclaim them. Artenia retained its strongholds to the east when their empire collapsed. Despite the collapse, they have managed to retain much of their culture and prosperity. 
### Values
The traditional values of the nation are pride in one's profession, integrity, and honor. The sense of pride that is encouraged throughout the populace has led to an emphasis on artisan craftsmanship, quality product, and pursuit of mastery in whatever one is doing. This has generally led to a generational approach to professions and has led to an expectation of mastery. This means beautiful craftsmanship is expected for all things in and coming out of Artenia, a disciplined, well-trained, very lethal military, an efficient, minimal beaurocracy underneath the monarchy, etc.
### Economy
Despite the political and military animosity that still exists between the New Empire and Artenia, there is still a bustling economic relationship between their citizens. While this economic relationship is not governmentally endorsed, Artenia does not actively prevent trade with the New Empire.
